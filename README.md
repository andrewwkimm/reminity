**Remivity** (**remi**nisce with bre**vity**) is a fast, private video and audio summarization tool that runs entirely locally. It currently supports YouTube URLs and audio files, and uses a local LLM of your choice to generate summaries, eliminating the need for external APIs and ensuring no data is sent to the cloud.
